# Research: State Management for Flutter

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: Borrowed Items Manager

## 1. Unknown To Be Resolved

The implementation plan for the Borrowed Items Manager identified a need to select a state management library for the Flutter application.

**From `plan.md`**:

> **Primary Dependencies**: `supabase_flutter`, `image_picker`, `flutter_contacts` (or similar), State Management (NEEDS CLARIFICATION: e.g., BLoC, Provider, Riverpod)

## 2. Research & Analysis

The choice of a state management library is critical for the scalability, maintainability, and testability of a Flutter application. We evaluated the most common and modern options suitable for a project using Supabase and a feature-driven architecture.

### 2.1. Options Considered

1.  **Provider**: A simple and widely used approach that relies on `InheritedWidget`. It's easy to learn and is often recommended for beginners.
2.  **BLoC (Business Logic Component)**: A powerful pattern that separates business logic from the UI layer completely. It's excellent for complex applications with many user interactions and data streams.
3.  **Riverpod**: A modern state management library created by the author of Provider. It aims to solve many of the common issues found in Provider, such as being dependent on the widget tree and providing more compile-time safety.

### 2.2. Evaluation Criteria

-   **Scalability**: How well does it scale as the app grows?
-   **Testability**: How easy is it to test the business logic?
-   **Boilerplate**: How much code is required for simple tasks?
-   **Developer Experience**: How intuitive and easy is it to use?
-   **Compatibility**: How well does it integrate with Supabase and asynchronous operations?

### 2.3. Comparison

| Library      | Scalability | Testability | Boilerplate  | Developer Experience | Compatibility |
| :----------- | :---------- | :---------- | :----------- | :------------------- | :------------ |
| **Provider** | Moderate    | Good        | Low          | Good                 | Good          |
| **BLoC**     | High        | Excellent   | High         | Moderate             | Excellent     |
| **Riverpod** | High        | Excellent   | Low-Moderate | Excellent            | Excellent     |

## 3. Decision & Rationale

**Decision**: We will use **Riverpod**.

**Rationale**:

1.  **Compile-Safe and Flexible**: Riverpod is not tied to the widget tree, which means providers can be accessed from anywhere in the application. This makes the architecture cleaner and avoids the `BuildContext` dependency issues common with Provider.
2.  **Excellent for Asynchronous Operations**: Riverpod has built-in support for handling `Future` and `Stream` with `FutureProvider` and `StreamProvider`. This is ideal for working with Supabase, which relies heavily on asynchronous calls for database operations, authentication, and real-time subscriptions.
3.  **Reduced Boilerplate**: Compared to BLoC, Riverpod requires significantly less boilerplate code to achieve similar results, which speeds up development without sacrificing testability or scalability.
4.  **Testability**: Logic encapsulated in Riverpod providers is easy to unit test by overriding provider dependencies in the test environment.
5.  **Modern and Future-Proof**: It is the recommended successor to Provider and represents a modern approach to state management in Flutter, with a growing community and excellent documentation.

This choice aligns well with the feature-driven architecture outlined in the `plan.md` and provides a solid foundation for building a robust and maintainable application.
