# Specification Quality Checklist: Borrowed items manager

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

    [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
    [x] Focused on user value and business needs
    [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
    [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

## Requirement Completeness

    [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
    [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
    [x] Success criteria are measurable
    [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
    [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
    [x] Edge cases are identified
    [x] Scope is clearly bounded
    [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

    [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
    [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
    [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
    [ ] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

    Items intentionally left as implementation decisions (auth, cloud photo storage) were supplied by the user and therefore appear in the spec. These make the spec less technology-agnostic in parts; please confirm you accept these scope choices before proceeding to planning.
    To fully satisfy the "No implementation details" and "No implementation details leak into specification" checks, we can extract these decisions into an "Implementation Decisions" appendix rather than embedding them in the main spec. Say if you'd like that change.

---

**Overall**: Spec is ready for planning pending your confirmation of scope decisions (auth+sync and cloud photo storage) which you already provided. If confirmed, this checklist can be marked complete.

-   Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
